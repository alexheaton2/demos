                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Part 1: Mindset Check-in (5 minutes)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Before we dive in, let's get into a growth mindset. The goal today isn't to be perfect, but to be curious about what challenges you. Take a moment to reflect on these questions:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Think of a time you struggled with a new idea (in any subject) but eventually understood it. What helped you finally "get it"?</li>
                    <li>Why is finding a "trouble spot" a good thing for learning?</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Section 2: Individual Work -->

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Part 2: The Hunt for Questions (15 minutes)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Your mission is to find problems that make you pause and think. This is your chance to pinpoint exactly where you can improve.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                    <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Khan Academy AP Calculus AB course</a>.</li>
                    <li>Choose one of the 8 Units that you want to test yourself on. Pick one you feel a bit shaky on.</li>
                    <li>Scroll to the bottom of the unit's topic list and start its "Unit Test".</li>
                    <li>As you work, be a detective. Look for questions that:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
                            <li>You get wrong.</li>
                            <li>You get right, but you were guessing or felt unsure.</li>
                            <li>You solve, but you know there must be a better or faster way.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you find a good "trouble spot" question, <strong class="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded">take a screenshot or otherwise save the question and its answer/explanation.</strong> Keep these handy for the next part. Aim to collect 2-3 questions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Part 3: Group Collaboration (Remaining Time)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">This is where we put the pieces together. By sharing our trouble spots, we can learn from everyone's unique perspective.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">The Process:</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
                    <li><strong>Share the Challenge:</strong> One person starts by sharing their screen to show one of their saved questions. Briefly explain what was tricky about it for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent Think Time (1-2 minutes):</strong> Everyone else silently examines the problem. Think: <em>"How would I start? What do I know? What's the key concept here?"</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Teach & Learn:</strong> After the quiet time, the floor is open. This is a group effort, not a test. Help each other by:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                            <li>Sharing the first step you would take.</li>
                            <li>Pointing out a key formula, theorem, or concept.</li>
                            <li>Drawing a quick sketch or graph on paper and showing it.</li>
                            <li>Explaining the "why" behind a step, not just the "how".</li>
                            <li>Offering a different way to approach the problem.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rotate Roles:</strong> After a few minutes of discussion on one problem, the next person in the group shares one of their questions. Repeat the process.</li>
                </ol>
