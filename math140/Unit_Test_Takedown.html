                <p>Work together in your small group to take an official Khan Academy Unit Test. Your goal is to collectively achieve a **100% score**. This is a great way to prepare for your upcoming exam.</p>
                <p>This activity is all about collaborative problem-solving and peer tutoring. You are encouraged to use any resource on the Khan Academy site—videos, articles, or hints from Khanmigo—to work through problems you don't understand.</p>
                <p class="p-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 text-blue-800"><strong>Before You Start:</strong> Please read all of the directions in the "How to Play" section below before beginning the unit test.</p>
                <p class="p-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-800"><strong>Important:</strong> This unit test is a review activity and is **not for a grade**. The goal is to learn together, not to perform under pressure.</p>

            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-6 text-slate-700">

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 inline-block">Get Started</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 pl-2">As a group, open up a Khan Academy Unit Test on one person's device. For example, you can find the test on the page for <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new" target="_blank" class="font-semibold text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Unit 2: Differentiation</a>, or another unit your instructor assigns.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 inline-block">Assign Roles</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 pl-2">Decide on one person whose job is to be the official **Timer**. This person will be responsible for setting a 2-minute timer for each new problem.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 inline-block">The 2-Minute Rule: Think First!</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 pl-2">When a new problem appears on the screen, the Timer starts a **2-minute timer**. During these two minutes, everyone in the group must work on the problem **individually and silently**. No talking! This ensures that every person has a chance to think through the problem on their own before the discussion begins.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 inline-block">Collaborate and Conquer</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 pl-2">After the 2-minute timer goes off, it's time to talk! Discuss your individual approaches. If you have different answers, defend your reasoning. If someone is stuck, work together to explain the concept. Once your group agrees on a final answer, enter it into the test.</p>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 inline-block">Use Your Resources</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 pl-2">If the entire group is stuck on a problem, that's a great sign that you've found a concept to review! Use the resources on Khan Academy—watch a video, read an article, or ask Khanmigo for a hint—to learn the material together before attempting the problem again.</p>

                    <li><strong>Identify Your Weak Spots.</strong> The goal isn't just to get 100%, but to figure out *why* you might miss a problem. Pay attention to the questions that cause the most debate in your group—these are excellent topics to review more before the exam.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be a Good Teammate.</strong> Listen to everyone's ideas and be patient. The goal is for everyone in the group to leave feeling more confident than when they started.</li>
